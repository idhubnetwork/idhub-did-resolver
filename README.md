# IDHub DID Resolver

This library is intended to use ethereum addresses as fully self managed Decentralized Identifiers and wrap them in a DID Document

It supports the proposed Decentralized Identifiers spec from the W3C Credentials Community Group.

The DID method relies on the [IDHub-DID-Registry](https://github.com/idhubnetwork/IDHub-DID-Registry).
